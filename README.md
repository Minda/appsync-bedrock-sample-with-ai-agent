# AWS AppSync Language Translation Playground

This code is a fork of a sample app provided by AWS. In this version, we've added our own GenAI language translation pipeline using AWS Transcribe, Bedrock, Claude, and [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) to a sample app using React, NodeJS and AWS Cloud Infrastructure. 

See this tutorial I wrote for Towards Data Science for detailed instructions on getting your AWS environment set up:
